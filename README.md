Weather Search project: A Tale of Two Cities

This project is aimed for use in an educational setting (elementary/middle school). It allows students or teachers to search two different cities (by entering city name) for weather information including: current weather condition (ie- cloudy, mist, clear skies), current temp (in Fahrenheit), min temp (in Fahrenheit),  max temp (in Fahrenheit), humidity (%). This data is returned using an API from Open Weather Map (https://openweathermap.org/) and is quickly available to the users to create/solve math problems using the data returned. It is built using responsive design that should allow users to view and use it on desktops, laptops, tablets & phones. Technologies used (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery) are simple and compatible with all browsers (still being tested...any issues please email me at nash311@gmail.com so that I can address them).
